# Task 2 Completion Guide: Usability Testing

This guide will help you complete Task 2 of your assignment, which involves submitting your prototype for usability testing, reviewing other students' prototypes, and analyzing the feedback you receive.

## Step 1: Submit Your Prototype for Testing

1. Access the "Prototype and Peer Review Dashboard" through the web links section in your course
2. Click on the "Usability Prototype Submission Form"
3. Submit the following information:
   - Your prototype URL (after deploying using GitHub Pages or Netlify)
   - The five objective usability tasks you created (these are listed in the README.md file)

## Step 2: Complete the "Your Prototype" Section in the Template

1. Download and open the "D479 Task 2 Template.docx"
2. In the "Your Prototype" section, enter:
   - Your name
   - Your prototype URL
   - The five objective usability tasks

## Step 3: Choose Three Peers' Prototypes to Review

1. Return to the "Prototype and Peer Review Dashboard"
2. Browse through the available prototypes
3. Select three prototypes to review
4. List each peer's name in the "Your Completed Peer Reviews" section of the template

## Step 4: Record Video Feedback for Each Prototype

For each of the three prototypes you selected:

1. Access Panopto through the "Panopto Access" web link
2. Log in using the "WGU" option
3. Select the recording folder "User Experience Design C856 | D479 (student creators) [assignments]"
4. Set up your recording to capture both you and your screen
5. For each prototype:
   - Attempt to complete each of the five usability tasks listed by the peer
   - Provide verbal narration and qualitative feedback as you work through each task
   - Share your reactions and thoughts about the user experience
6. After recording, set the viewing permissions:
   - Open the video in Panopto
   - Go to Settings > Share
   - Select "Your Organization (unlisted), anyone at your organization who has the link can view"
7. Submit the link to each video using the "Submit Prototype Review - Link" on the dashboard
8. Include these links in the "Your Completed Peer Reviews" section of the template

## Step 5: Wait for Feedback on Your Prototype

After you've provided feedback on three prototypes, you'll be able to view the video feedback from other students on your own design. This may take some time as other students complete their reviews.

## Step 6: Summarize the Feedback You Received

Once you've received feedback:

1. List each peer reviewer's name and Panopto review link in the "Peer Reviews of Your Prototype" section of the template
2. Summarize the feedback you received for each of your five usability tasks
3. Specify which feedback is actionable (can be implemented to improve your design) and which is not actionable (cannot be implemented or is not relevant)

## Step 7: Summarize Your Design Changes

In the appropriate section of the template:

1. Describe how your design evolved from the initial wireframe to the final prototype
2. Include specific details about:
   - Changes made after guerrilla testing in Task 1
   - Changes you would make based on the feedback from Task 2
   - How these changes improved the user experience

## Step 8: Complete the Template

1. Add any necessary citations using APA format
2. Proofread your submission for professional communication
3. Submit the completed template

## Important Notes

- The file size limit for your submission cannot exceed 200 MB
- Individual files should not exceed 16 MB
- Make sure your videos capture both you and your screen simultaneously
- Wear professional attire in your videos
- If you have problems accessing Panopto or the recording folder, contact Assessment Services at assessmentservices@wgu.edu

## Using Your Taniti Tourism Prototype

1. A responsive website with all required pages
2. Support for the five usability tasks:
   - Navigate to the Attractions page from the homepage
   - Find a snorkeling tour and proceed to the booking page
   - Find a mid-range bed & breakfast option in Taniti
   - Find information on available taxi services on the island
   - Access the website on a mobile device and navigate to the Visitor Essentials section
