This is an interactive prototype for the Taniti Tourism website, designed to showcase the island's attractions, activities, lodging options, and essential visitor information. The prototype is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is designed to be responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Overview

The prototype includes:

- Interactive navigation and booking functionality
- Detailed information about attractions, activities, and lodging options
- Essential visitor information including safety, currency, and transportation details

- `styles.css` - The CSS styles for the website
- `script.js` - The JavaScript functionality for the website
- Various HTML files for different sections of the website:
  - `attractions.html` - Information about Taniti's attractions
  - `activities.html` - Information about activities available on the island
  - `lodging.html` - Information about lodging options

## Design Decisions

This prototype was designed based on:

1. A persona profile of a typical Taniti tourist
2. A low-fidelity wireframe showing the suggested flow of the website
3. Feedback from guerrilla usability testing with three user testers

Key design decisions include:

- Adding a prominent "Book Now" button in the header
- Emphasizing top activities with larger thumbnails
- Ensuring mobile-friendly design with appropriate layouts
- Making the CTA more prominent in the hero section
- Adding emergency contacts in the footer's "Visitor Info" section
- Creating a dedicated "Book Your Stay" page
- Providing both grid and carousel options for activities
